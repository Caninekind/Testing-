    <!-- Origin Story -->

        <div class="container-narrow">
            <h2 class="text-center mb-2">My Story</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <p><strong>I started Decoding Dogs Training because I wanted to create the training program that I wish I could access when I was first struggling with my dog back in 2012.</strong></p>
                <p>Like many dog owners, I found myself overwhelmed and unsure of how to handle the challenges that came with my dog, Myra. I needed step-by-step guidance, clear answers, and someone who understood what I was going through. That experience shaped everything about how I approach dog training today.</p>
                <p>In 2017, I began offering private training lessons to friends and family, and quickly realized that many dog owners were facing the same struggles I had experienced. Since then, I've dedicated myself to helping owners build better relationships with their dogs through effective communication and balanced training methods.</p>

    <!-- Training Philosophy -->
    <section class="section-light">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">My Training Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="card-grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Balanced Training Approach</h3>
                    <p>I believe in using what works for each individual dog. This means incorporating a variety of humane, effective training tools and methods—including relationship building, play, motivation, and e-collar training—to help your dog succeed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Communication is Key</h3>
                    <p>Training is all about teaching you and your dog how to communicate clearly with each other. When you both understand what's expected, living together becomes easier and more enjoyable.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Customized for Your Dog</h3>
                    <p>Every dog has a unique personality, learning style, and set of challenges. I create personalized training plans that fit your dog's needs and your specific goals—not a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>No Judgment, Just Support</h3>
                    <p>I've been where you are. I understand the frustration, the confusion, and the feeling that you're failing your dog. You're not. My job is to support you, answer your questions, and help you succeed—without any judgment.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mb-2">What Makes Me Different</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h4>Real-World Experience</h4>
                <p>I've been training dogs professionally for several years, but more importantly, I've lived the challenges that come with difficult dog behaviors. My approach comes from both professional expertise and personal understanding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card mt-2">
                <h4>Ongoing Education</h4>
                <p>Dog training is constantly evolving, and I'm committed to staying current. I regularly attend continuing education opportunities to bring you the most effective, up-to-date training methods.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card mt-2">
                <h4>Focus on Relationship Building</h4>
                <p>Training isn't just about obedience—it's about building a strong, trusting relationship between you and your dog. When that foundation is in place, everything else falls into place more naturally.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card mt-2">
                <h4>Practical, Realistic Training</h4>
                <p>I don't believe in making promises I can't keep. I'll be honest with you about what's achievable, how long it will take, and what you need to do to see results. Success requires your commitment and daily practice.</p>
